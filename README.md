We chose the first option from all 3 files, meaning we:
### 1. Added a working room above the building, with stairs access from inside the building and light inside.
### 2. Added a jump option for the player. pressing spacebar will make the player jump
### 3. Added a better enemy AI. Now you have the choice to make the enemy walk to the closest target to the player (brave chaser), walk to furthest target from the player (scared runawayer), or walk to the engine in the middle of the building (destroyer). You can choose which action to preform using the enemyControllerStateMachine script.

all the changes are inside 4-ai/c-controller scene
